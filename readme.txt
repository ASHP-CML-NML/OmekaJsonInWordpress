For this plugin to work, you will need an installation of Omeka on
the same domain as your wordpress site. The plugin is built to work 
with Omeka as some arbitrary [configurable via the wordpress admin 
panel] subdirectory underneath the Wordpress url.

To configure, install the plugin and set the subdirectory in the configuration
panel.

To make pages pull data from Omeka, create a new page in Wordpress. Give that page
a title [it can be different from Omeka] and fill in the Omeka pull field
underneath the primary text area with the ID number from Omeka of the entry
you would like to pull.
